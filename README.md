Methods
1. Analytical methods / Closed form solutions ==> Black-Scholes Model 
2. Numerical methods 
The value of a derivate, in the vast majority of situations, has no analytical solution, and we turn to numerical approach. 
  - Finite Different Methods
  prons:
  can be adapted to a wide variety of UA price dynamics. 
  well suited to price American options
  cons:
  instability ==> horizontal, rectangular shape; finer space discretiztion, even finer time discretization 
  curse of dimensionality ==> difficut to implement as the number of state variables increases 
  
    - Explicit Finite Differences Methods(EFDM) -- recursive algorithm
    create a time-space-discreted grid, approximation of Greeks, boudary conditions 
    for American option, systematically take the maximum between the exercise value and the continuation value 
    - Implicit Finite Differences Methods(IFDM)
    - Crank-Nicolson algorithm  -- combination of EFDM and IFDM 
    - 2-dimensional example 
  curse of dimensionality ==> difficut to implement as the number of state variables increases 
  
  - Monte Carlo Simulation 
  simulating paths for the price of UA ## euler 
  prons:
  flexible, the difficult does not increase with dimension
  cons:
  challenging to evaluate American options
